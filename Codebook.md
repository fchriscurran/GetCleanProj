This file describes the variables contained in the tidy data set.

Variables:
*ubject = the number of the subject
*activitynumber = a number uniquely identifying activities
*Group.1 = a unique identifier for subject and activity

*The remaining variables represent the different outcomes.  The variables ending in mean() represent the mean for the subject on the measure of that activity.  The variables ending in std() represent the corresponding standard deviation.
